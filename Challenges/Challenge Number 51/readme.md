# Step 51 - Passed

### Something does not look right. You added the correct `class` attribute value to the `p` element with `Donut` as its text, but you have not defined a selector for it.

### The CSS rule for the `flavor` class already sets the properties you want. Add the `dessert` class as an additional selector for this CSS rule.
