## So far you have been using type and id selectors to style elements. However, it is more common to use a different selector to style your elements.

### A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:
```css
.class-name {
  styles
}
```
### Change the existing `#menu` selector into a class selector by replacing `#menu` with a class named `.menu`.
